      <p style="text-align: center;">Going into space for the first time can be quite the disorientating task, so
        it
        is very important to take
        the
        entire process extremely seriously and listen carefully to our experienced guides so that our first
        experience
        in
        space can be enjoyable and successful . At Space Tourism, we take pride in providing a smooth and safe
        launch
        experience for all of our travelers. We understand that going into space can be an intimidating
        experience,
        but with
        the help of our guides and a bit of preparation, it is possible to make the journey as enjoyable and
        stress-free as
        possible All travelers will be required to keep their holsters on at all times until they are instructed
        to
        remove
        them, after that, they’ll be able to fully take in the stars.
      </p>
      <div id="recovery" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Recovery</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Upon returning to Earth, travelers will need to learn how to readjust to
          Earth’s gravity and gain a sense
          of
          their
          own weight again. The process of readjustment can be a difficult one; the traveler will need to re-learn
          how
          to move
          their body and regulate their balance with gravity. Because of this, the final three days of your journey
          will
          include a complimentary training regime to ensure your transition to the blue planet will be as if you
          never
          left.
          Through physical activities such as swimming and weightlifting, travellers will be able to slowly regain
          the
          ability
          to move their bodies with normal gravity. For their safety, our travelers will be instructed to ease up
          for
          roughly
          a week after returning to their regular lives.
