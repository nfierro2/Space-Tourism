            <p style="text-align: center;">Going into space for the first time can be quite the
              disorientating task, so it
              is very important to take
              the
              entire process extremely seriously and listen carefully to our experienced guides so that our first
              experience
              in
              space can be enjoyable and successful . At Space Tourism, we take pride in providing a smooth and safe
              launch
              experience for all of our travelers. We understand that going into space can be an intimidating
              experience,
              but with
              the help of our guides and a bit of preparation, it is possible to make the journey as enjoyable and
              stress-free as
              possible All travelers will be required to keep their holsters on at all times until they are instructed
              to
              remove
              them, after that, they’ll be able to fully take in the stars.
            </p>

          <div id="recovery" class="tab-pane fade">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Recovery</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Upon returning to Earth, travelers will need to learn how to
              readjust to
              Earth’s gravity and gain a sense
              of
              their
              own weight again. The process of readjustment can be a difficult one; the traveler will need to re-learn
              how
              to move
              their body and regulate their balance with gravity. Because of this, the final three days of your journey
              will
              include a complimentary training regime to ensure your transition to the blue planet will be as if you
              never
              left.
              Through physical activities such as swimming and weightlifting, travellers will be able to slowly regain
              the
              ability
              to move their bodies with normal gravity. For their safety, our travelers will be instructed to ease up
              for
              roughly
              a week after returning to their regular lives.
