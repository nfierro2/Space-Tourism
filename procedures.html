        <h3>Prepare to Launch</h3>
        <p>Going into space for the first time can be quite the disorientating task, so it is very important to take the
          entire process extremely seriously and listen carefully to our experienced guides so that our first experience
          in
          space can be enjoyable and successful . At Space Tourism, we take pride in providing a smooth and safe launch
          experience for all of our travelers. We understand that going into space can be an intimidating experience,
          but with
          the help of our guides and a bit of preparation, it is possible to make the journey as enjoyable and
          stress-free as
          possible All travelers will be required to keep their holsters on at all times until they are instructed to
          remove
          them, after that, they’ll be able to fully take in the stars.

        <h3>Recovery</h3>
        <p>Upon returning to Earth, travelers will need to learn how to readjust to Earth’s gravity and gain a sense of
          their
          own weight again. The process of readjustment can be a difficult one; the traveler will need to re-learn how
          to move
          their body and regulate their balance with gravity. Because of this, the final three days of your journey will
          include a complimentary training regime to ensure your transition to the blue planet will be as if you never
          left.
          Through physical activities such as swimming and weightlifting, travellers will be able to slowly regain the
          ability
          to move their bodies with normal gravity. For their safety, our travelers will be instructed to ease up for
          roughly
          a week after returning to their regular lives.
